yait ( yet another init tool )

yait is designed to allow you to create more side projects; that you will
definitely complete. This tool will create a new directory containing all
project files needed for your new C ( maybe C++ ) project. It provides you with
a build system and some basic source files to give you a kick start on your new
project--with optional libraries!
