yait ( yet another init tool )

yait is designed to allow you to create more side projects; that you will
definitely finish. This tool will create a new directory containing all
project files needed for your new and shinny C project--all for the
price of a hat. This includes a build system and some basic source files
to give you a kick start on your new project--with optional libraries!
