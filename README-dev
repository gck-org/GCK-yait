Build system
------------

This distribution uses the a GNU autotools-like build system. This is
made up of a configure script, and a Makefile. The configure script
detects a GNU compliant C compiler on the system and sets any program
flags: debug, release, custom. The Makefile builds the binary based on
the output [config.mak] of the configure script.


Building
--------

To build this distribution you first must run the configure script. This
outputs a config.mak file that will be used in the Make step. Then run
make; this builds the objects into build/ and the binary into bin/.


Configuration
-------------

The configuration script is used to generate a build intermediate step
called the config.mak. This file is used by the Makefile to figure out
GNU compilant C compiler to use, what CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to use, and
where to install the binary if requested. By default these values are
gcc, the release flag set, and /usr/bin/. The configuration script
supports the following flags that control CFLAGS: --release, --debug
and CFLAGS="". Release is the default, and is set for the fastest
runtime and size. Debug is for in-development programming and is the
strictest when it comes to warnings and other compiler output.
CFLAGS="" is for custom flag definition.
