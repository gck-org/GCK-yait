styles
######

In yait there are a few pre-made styles you can choose from. Those styles being
the following.
	* posix (default)
	* gnu
	* simple
	* lib
	* fasm
These can be selected through setting the --style=<STYLE> flag.

The POSIX style is the default style of yait and is the format used for the
project. The POSIX style is structured as the following:
	project/
		bin/
		build/
		doc/
		include/
			project.h
		man/
			project.1
		src/
			main.c
		COPYING
		Makefile
		README

The GNU style is based on the GNU project layout guide; however, it is minified.
	project/
		man/
			project.1
		src/
			main.c
		AUTHORS
		COPYING
		INSTALL
		NEWS
		README
		configure.ac

The Simple style is a minimal layout for short and sweet projects.
	project/
		project.c
		Makefile
		README

The Lib style is a layout for created libraries that compile to a .a and .so file.
	project/
		include/
			project.h
		src/
			project.c
		Makefile
		README

The Fasm style is a layout based on the flat assembler.
	project/
		SOURCE/
			main.c
